CMSC 320 Final Tutorial

By: Akshay Kapur

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the Data Science pipeline by walking the reader through its various phases. 
These phases include data collection and parsing, data management and representation, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing,
and communication of insights attained. The tutorial will be presented in the form of a self-contained Jupyter Notebook containing both
Markdown explanations and Python code. The subject matter of the tutorial is less important than the ability to clearly communicate 
the approach and discuss the implications of the final results.
